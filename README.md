# AMOLED-discord
 A custom CSS File that lets you have an AMOLED theme on desktop! No need for a custom client.

## Installation Info:
Just Download amoled.css, then go to Dev Console in discord (CTRL + SHIFT + I). Then navigate to the sources tab, you may have to hit the arrow button to show more options (top of devtool window).

Then expand the assets folder in there, and look for the only file that ends in .css, hit ctrl-a, then paste in the entire contents of amoled.css. Then wait a bit this may take some time. 

As of now you WILL HAVE TO RE-DO this every time you open discord.
