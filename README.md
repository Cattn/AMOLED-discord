# Discord-Themes
 A custom CSS File that lets you have an AMOLED theme on desktop! No need for a custom client.

## Installation Info:

## BE WARNED, this is outdated (might update it soon)


WARNING:
> Do not use this with other client mods such as Better Discord/Vencord, etc. It may cause issues and require a re-install.
### Installation Method 1: (Recommended)
Pick a theme (Will be named: Themename.js), copy it's contents and paste it into your discord console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and hit enter. (Not sure how to access console? Scroll down.)

### Installation Method 2: (Manual)
Just Download your theme from the css folder, then go to Dev Console in discord (CTRL + SHIFT + I). Then navigate to the sources tab, you may have to hit the arrow button to show more options (top of devtool window).

Then expand the assets folder in there, and look for the only file that ends in .css, hit ctrl-a, then paste in the entire contents of amoled.css. Then wait a bit this may take some time. 

As of now you WILL HAVE TO RE-DO this every time you open discord.

### Extra Info
Why are you using a file hosted on discord?
> Discord only allows files from certain sources, and github isn't one of them, so I instead uploaded the file to discord and linked it here. I will update the link with updates to this code. Feel free to upload it yourself if you want to and replace the link.
