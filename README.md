# AMOLED-discord
 A custom CSS File that lets you have an AMOLED theme on desktop! No need for a custom client.

## Installation Info:

### Installation Method 1: (Recommended)
Go to inject.js, copy it's contents and paste it into your console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and hit enter.

### Installation Method 2: (Manual)
Just Download amoled.css, then go to Dev Console in discord (CTRL + SHIFT + I). Then navigate to the sources tab, you may have to hit the arrow button to show more options (top of devtool window).

Then expand the assets folder in there, and look for the only file that ends in .css, hit ctrl-a, then paste in the entire contents of amoled.css. Then wait a bit this may take some time. 

As of now you WILL HAVE TO RE-DO this every time you open discord.

### Extra Info
Why are you using a file hosted on discord?
> Discord only allows files from certain sources, and github isn't one of them, so I instead uploaded the file to discord and linked it here. I will update the link with updates to this code. Feel free to upload it yourself if you want to and replace the link.
